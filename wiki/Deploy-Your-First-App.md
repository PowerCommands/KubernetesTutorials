# Deploy a simple web application
This example will guide you trough the steps to deploy one webb application in one pod on a Docker Desktop K8:s kluster. As the Docker Desktop K8:s environment only consist of one kluster already prepared for you, the creation of a K8:s kluster is omitted. The code examples is using an [alias](../README.md) **k** for **kubectl**

## Deployment
### Get the nodes of our K8:s kluster, just to know that your kubernetes kluster is up and running.

``` 
k get nodes
```
Should return something like this on a fresh install.
``` 
NAME             STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
docker-desktop   Ready    control-plane   22h   v1.25.2
``` 
### Create a deployment
``` 
k create deployment kubernetes-bootcamp --image=bkimminich/juice-shop:latest
``` 
**View your result**
``` 
k get deployments
``` 
``` 
NAME                  READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
kubernetes-bootcamp   0/1     1            0           7s
``` 
### Create a service
You now have a pod running, you can check that out with 
``` 
k get pods
``` 
``` 
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kubernetes-bootcamp-6b7cccd9c4-ftljv   1/1     Running   0          3m38s
``` 
To expose your app you need a K8:s to ge a IP address reachable outside the K8:s kluster.
We create a new service like this:
``` 
k expose deployment/kubernetes-bootcamp --type="NodePort" --port 3000
```
Check out your new service.
``` 
k get services
```
``` 
NAME                  TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
kubernetes            ClusterIP   10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP          22h
kubernetes-bootcamp   NodePort    10.103.59.168   <none>        3000:30460/TCP   111s
``` 
Open this URL in your browser: http://localhost:30460
If itÂ´s not working, check the port number after 3000: it may not be the same as this example.

You shoud now see the famous OWASP Juice shop!

Congratulations you have now deployed your first K8:s application and made it reachable outside your K8:s kluster.

### Tips if you want to create files (called manifest) you can add --output="yaml" like this:
```
k create deployment kubernetes-bootcamp --image=bkimminich/juice-shop:latest --output="yaml"
```
This manifest file could be saved and use to recreate your application on a different kluster. With this command:
```
kubectl apply -f bootcamp-deployment.yaml
```
And for the service.
```
kubectl apply -f bootcamp-service.yaml
```
